## VNExpress Golang reader
My goal for the original reader is for my mom to use it, not me. I've made a much better Python version, but the problem is, i can't really "ship" the app to my mom's laptop as Python is a interpreted language and using Pyinstaller is also troublesome. This is my first experience with Golang so the code may not be good. Contributions are VERY appreciated.

## Usage:
```
git clone https://github.com/tuanthanhnguyen/vnexpress_reader_golang.git
cd vnexpress_reader_golang
go mod tidy
go run ./
```
